# ML-Algorithms-and-Neural-Networks

Implementations of various machine learning algorithms and neural network models including linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, predictive modeling, neural networks, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

## Implemented Algorithms and Models

1. **Linear Regression**
   - A regression model that predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
   
2. **Logistic Regression**
   - A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes based on predictor variables.
   
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A non-parametric classification and regression algorithm that makes predictions based on the k-nearest training examples in the feature space.
   
4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Techniques and models used to predict future outcomes based on historical data. Various approaches and algorithms are employed to build robust predictive models.
   
5. **Neural Networks**
   - A set of algorithms modeled loosely after the human brain that are designed to recognize patterns. Implementations include simple feedforward neural networks as well as more complex architectures.
   
6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - A powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
   
7. **Naive Bayes Model**
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
